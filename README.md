# herp-interns

Code used by Herpetology Interns 2016-2017  
Part of the AMNH BridgeUp: STEM program.  

Update 6/12/2017: I have added all of the code and CSV data that I have but the bulk of the code and the results are stored with the 6 interns who contributed to this project. See their repos for additional code.
